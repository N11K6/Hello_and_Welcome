# Hello and Welcome

This repository is a small collection of Machine Learning projects that could be considered my portfolio. 

I will be adding some short and perhaps some longer projects that I feel are indicative of my research interests and working methods.

As I am primarily a DSP and Machine Learning engineer, the projects included are all in this direction. Each subdirectory here corresponds to a separate project, which includes all the scripts and data necessary to run and replicate my results. In cases where data has not been uploaded to Github, download links are provided. 

The majority of my work is in python 3. However, where applicable, I recommend accessing these projects through the **.ipynb** files included in the Notebooks subdirectory of the corresponding project. This is because:

  1. Markdown allows for clear and extensive comments on the code, helping the viewer understand the workflow.
  2. Each cell can be run and show output individually, allowing for the viewer to monitor each step of the process.
  3. One can run .ipynb files on various web apps that are freely available. This means you don't even need to have python installed
     in your machine to use the notebooks, as long as you can upload them to an online environment such as Google colab.

You are always encouraged to download the actual code in python and try the programs out for yourselves. I strive to keep my code tidy and easily understandable. 

*Currently planning to make some of the programs work with a REST API through Flask, in order to provide much nicer demonstrations.*
